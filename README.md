# Plagiarism-Detector
# üìò Project Title: Plagiarism Detector using Machine Learning
# üß† Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning-based system that can detect textual plagiarism. The model analyzes text inputs, compares their semantic and syntactic features, and classifies whether the content is plagiarized or original.

# üîç What is Plagiarism?
Plagiarism is the act of presenting someone else‚Äôs work or ideas as one‚Äôs own without proper attribution. This can occur in written text, code, research, and creative works. The project focuses specifically on identifying plagiarism in textual documents.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies and Libraries Used:
Python

# Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

# Scikit-learn (sklearn)

# Pandas, NumPy

# TfidfVectorizer for feature extraction

# WordCloud for visualization

# Matplotlib for plotting

# Joblib for model persistence

# Machine Learning Models:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

# üìÇ Dataset:
The dataset contained the source text and the plagiarised text to predict the plagiarism accurately.

# üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow:
# Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Mounted Google Drive to load the dataset.

Preprocessed text by removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, and removing stopwords using NLTK.

Text Vectorization:

Used TfidfVectorizer to convert text data into numerical feature vectors representing word importance.

# Model Building and Training:

# Trained multiple classification models to detect plagiarism:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

SVM

# Used train_test_split for model validation and tested models on unseen data.

# Model Evaluation:

Evaluated models using metrics like:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

ROC AUC Score

Classification Report

# Visualization:

Generated word clouds to visualize the most frequent words in the text.

Plotted performance metrics using matplotlib.

# Model Comparison:

Compared performance of different classifiers to choose the best model for detecting plagiarism.

# ‚úÖ Outcome:
The project successfully demonstrates how machine learning models can be trained to detect plagiarism in textual content with high accuracy. Among the models tested, the best-performing model was identified based on its ability to classify texts as plagiarized or not.
